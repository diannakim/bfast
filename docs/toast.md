2.  **Remove** the two slices of bread from the toaster after they are finished toasting. **Place** the slices of bread on a plate and set it aside.
    > **NOTE:** You will find plates and bowls in the cabinet above the dishwasher.

3.  **Cut** the ripe avocado in half.

    > **NOTE:** You will find knives in the knife block next to the microwave and cutting boards, forks, and spoons in the cabinet below the microwave.

4.  **Scoop** the avocado from the skin and place it into a small bowl.

5.  **Smash** the avocado using a fork to create an avocado mash (Refer to Figure 2).

    > **NOTE:** The less you smash the avocado, the chunkier your mash will be!
